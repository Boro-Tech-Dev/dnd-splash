# Convert to Static Site for Shared Hosting

Since you have shared hosting without Node.js support, we need to convert this to a static site.

## What needs to be done:

1. **Remove API functionality** - Email signup won't work without server
2. **Convert to static HTML** - Use plain HTML/CSS/JS
3. **Keep animations** - Can use CSS animations instead of React
4. **Simple contact form** - Use a third-party service like Formspree

## Alternative: Use a static site generator

- Export Next.js as static files
- Use services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages
- These are FREE and support Next.js

## Third-party email services:
- Formspree.io
- Netlify Forms
- EmailJS
- Getform.io

Would you like me to:
A) Convert to static HTML/CSS/JS for shared hosting
B) Set up deployment on Vercel/Netlify (FREE and easier)
C) Help you upgrade to VPS hosting on Hostwinds
